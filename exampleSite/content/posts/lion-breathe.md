Developed from pranayama traditions, the 4-7-8 breathing pattern acts as a "neurological switch" to halt fight-or-flight responses. Clinical trials show this method increases heart rate variability (HRV) by 31% within 90 seconds - a key biomarker of stress resilience.  

**Practice Sequence:**  
1. Exhale completely through pursed lips  
2. Close mouth, silent nose inhale (4 seconds)  
3. Hold breath (7 seconds)  
4. Exhale forcefully through mouth (8 seconds)  
5. Repeat 3 cycles max initially  

*Scientific Findings:*  
- Reduces amygdala hyperactivity by 42% (UCLA Neuroimaging Study 2024)  
- Boosts GABA production more effectively than 20mg Diazepam (J. Psychosom. Med)  
- 78% of ER patients halted panic attacks in Tokyo trials  

*Contraindications:*  
- Avoid during acute asthma attacks  
- Not recommended for untreated hypertension  
- Limit to 4 cycles/day for first-time practitioners
