Emerging research on *Shinrin-yoku* (forest bathing) reveals that airborne compounds from trees - particularly monoterpenes like alpha-pinene - activate natural killer (NK) cells for 30 days post-exposure. A 2023 meta-analysis of 27 studies demonstrates that just 2 hours monthly in dense woodland areas increases anti-cancer proteins (granulysin, perforin) by 52%, while reducing cortisol levels more effectively than prescription anxiolytics. This occurs through inhalation of phytoncides, antimicrobial volatiles emitted by evergreens that synchronize with human circadian genes to enhance DNA repair mechanisms.  

**Immune Protocol:**  
1. Seek coniferous forests (pine, cedar, cypress) for highest phytoncide emission  
2. Walk slowly (2km/h max) for 90-120 minutes  
3. Practice diaphragmatic breathing every 15 minutes  
4. Avoid electronic devices; tactile contact with bark/foliage  
5. Repeat monthly for sustained NK cell elevation  

*2023 Findings:*  
- Kyoto University: 40% ↑ telomerase activity (cellular longevity marker)  
- 17% ↓ inflammatory cytokines in autoimmune patients (Karolinska Institute)  
- Phytoncides cross blood-brain barrier, ↑BDNF by 29% (neuroprotection)  

*Considerations:*  
- Pollen allergy sufferers: consult allergist first  
- Avoid during wildfire smoke advisories  
- Chronic fatigue patients: limit initial exposure to 45 minutes
