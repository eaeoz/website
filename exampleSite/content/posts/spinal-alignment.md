Chronic poor posture compresses intervertebral discs by up to 145%, impeding cerebrospinal fluid flow and reducing nutrient delivery to spinal nerves. A 2023 *Journal of Orthopaedic Research* study found that 12 weeks of postural correction decreased thoracic kyphosis by 19° and improved lung capacity by 22% through diaphragm decompression. Proper alignment optimizes vagus nerve signaling, enhancing parasympathetic tone by 37% (UCLA Neurology data), while reducing mechanical stress on the brachial plexus—a key contributor to chronic migraines and peripheral neuropathy.  

**Alignment Protocol:**  
1. Perform chin tucks (5x daily) to strengthen deep cervical flexors  
2. Use lumbar support maintaining natural spinal curvature during seated work  
3. Wall angels exercise (3x10 reps daily) to retract scapulae  
4. Sleep in fetal position with pillow between knees (neutralizes lumbar strain)  
5. 5-minute prone extension breaks hourly (reverse slouching)  

*2023 Clinical Evidence:*  
- Harvard Biomechanics Lab: Postural correction ↑ proprioceptive accuracy by 41%  
- 33% ↓ chronic tension headaches in desk workers (Stanford Occupational Health Trial)  
- Improved T1-T4 alignment ↑ heart rate variability by 29% (Cleveland Clinic Study)  

*Contraindications:*  
- Acute herniated discs or spinal fractures  
- Osteoporosis patients: avoid aggressive extension  
- Post-spinal surgery: consult physiotherapist first
