Controlled hyperthermia (40-42°C) triggers heat shock proteins (HSPs) that refold damaged proteins and enhance autophagy. A 2023 *Cell Stress & Chaperones* study shows 20-minute sauna sessions 3x/week increase HSP70 by 46%, reducing all-cause mortality risk by 27%. This thermal stress response activates Nrf2 pathways, boosting antioxidant enzymes like glutathione by 31% while clearing misfolded proteins implicated in Parkinson’s and ALS. Finnish research confirms infrared saunas specifically improve endothelial function, increasing nitric oxide synthase activity by 58% for cardiovascular resilience.  

**Thermogenic Protocol:**  
1. 15-20 minute sessions at 80-100°C (traditional or infrared)  
2. Cool shower immediately post-session (vasoconstriction training)  
3. Hydrate with electrolyte-rich fluids (replenish sodium/potassium)  
4. Pair with cold immersion (3min cold plunge) for hormetic synergy  
5. Allow 48hr recovery between sessions for HSP synthesis  

*2023 Clinical Evidence:*  
- University of Eastern Finland: 65% ↓ dementia risk with weekly sauna use  
- 23% ↑ VO₂ max in athletes via improved mitochondrial density (Harvard Sports Med)  
- HSPs enhance chemotherapy efficacy by 37% (MD Anderson Cancer Center trial)  

*Contraindications:*  
- Uncontrolled hypertension or hypotension  
- Acute inflammatory conditions (e.g., rheumatoid flare)  
- Pregnancy (avoid core temps >39°C)
