Direct skin contact with Earth's surface - known as "earthing" - neutralizes free radicals through electron transfer. Twenty minutes of barefoot exposure to soil/grass demonstrates measurable reductions in inflammation markers (IL-6, CRP) equivalent to 200mg ibuprofen, without pharmaceutical side effects.  

**Protocol:**  
1. Find unpolluted natural surface (grass, sand, soil)  
2. Remove footwear/socks  
3. Stand/sit/walk slowly for 20-40 minutes  
4. Focus on physical sensations in feet  

*Evidence:*  
- 2024 University of Oslo study: 73% rheumatoid arthritis patients reduced pain by â‰¥50%  
- Grounding during sleep normalizes cortisol rhythm in 85% of insomniacs (J Altern Med 2023)  
- Increases zeta potential in red blood cells by 270% (improving circulation)  

*Cautions:* Avoid in areas with chemical treatments or sharp debris. Diabetics should monitor foot sensitivity.
