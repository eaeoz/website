Deep non-REM sleep stages activate the glymphatic system, a cerebral waste-clearance mechanism that removes neurotoxic beta-amyloid plaques 10x faster than wakefulness. A 2023 *Nature Neuroscience* study reveals 7-9 hours of sleep cycles increase cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pulsatility by 90%, flushing metabolic byproducts linked to neurodegeneration. This nocturnal "brain wash" relies on synchronized slow-wave oscillations (0.5-4Hz) that expand interstitial spaces by 60%, allowing CSF to circulate through perivascular tunnels and export tau proteins implicated in Alzheimer’s pathology.  

**Circadian Optimization Protocol:**  
1. Maintain 18°C bedroom temperature (ideal for vasodilation)  
2. 90-minute pre-sleep wind-down: dim red lights + magnesium glycinate  
3. Align sleep onset with core body temperature drop (typically 10-11pm)  
4. Use contoured pillow to optimize cervical spine alignment  
5. 20-minute afternoon nap (if needed) before 3pm  

*2023 Research Breakthroughs:*  
- Stanford Sleep Lab: 8hr sleep ↑ CSF flow by 2.8L/night (vs 1.2L in 6hr sleep)  
- 44% ↓ amyloid plaques in APOE4 carriers with stage N3 sleep extension (MIT Aging Study)  
- Glymphatic activation repairs blood-brain barrier via astrocyte regulation (Oxford Neurology)  

*Contraindications:*  
- Narcolepsy/sleep apnea patients: consult specialist first  
- Avoid melatonin supplements if on immunosuppressants  
- Limit fluids 2hr pre-bed if nocturia occurs
