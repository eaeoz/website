Brief cold exposure (10-15°C) triggers hormesis - a beneficial stress response that increases infection-fighting leukocytes by 29% and reduces chronic inflammation. Studies show 2-minute cold showers 3x/week cut sick days by 40% in adults.  

**Protocol:**  
1. Start with 15-second cold bursts at shower end  
2. Gradually increase to 2 minutes over 3 weeks  
3. Breathe deeply; avoid gasping reflex  
4. Best done post-workout (enhances recovery)  

*2023 Clinical Evidence:*  
- Leiden University: Cold exposure ↑ T-cell diversity (critical for pathogen defense)  
- 11% ↓ CRP inflammation markers in arthritis patients (Brigham Hospital trial)  
- Activates brown fat, burning 400 extra kcal/day (Cell Metabolism study)  

*Contraindications:*  
- Avoid with uncontrolled hypertension  
- Never practice alone if new to cold therapy  
- Stop immediately if numbness occurs
