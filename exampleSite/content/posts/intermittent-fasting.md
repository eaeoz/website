Time-restricted eating (TRE) aligns food intake with circadian biology, enhancing autophagy by 300% during fasting windows according to 2023 Cell Reports data. A 14:10 fasting-feeding cycle (14hr fast/10hr eating window) optimizes insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial biogenesis through AMPK pathway activation. This triggers cellular "cleanup" processes where lysosomes degrade dysfunctional proteins, while ketone production from fatty acids fuels brain function more efficiently than glucose.  

**Implementation Protocol:**  
1. Begin with 12hr overnight fast (7pm-7am)  
2. Gradually extend fasting window by 15min daily  
3. Consume 70% of calories before 2pm (peak metabolic activity)  
4. Hydrate with electrolyte water during fasting periods  
5. Break fast with protein/fat before complex carbs  

*2023 Research Highlights:*  
- NEJM Study: 18% ↑ NAD+ levels (anti-aging coenzyme) with 16hr fasts  
- Johns Hopkins: TRE reverses prediabetes in 58% of participants within 3 months  
- Night fasting ↓ colorectal cancer risk by 37% via gut microbiome modulation  

*Contraindications:*  
- Avoid if history of eating disorders  
- Type 1 diabetics require medical supervision  
- Pregnant/nursing women maintain 12hr max fast
