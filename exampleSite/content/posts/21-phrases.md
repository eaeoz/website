For greetings, always use Ms and not Mrs when writing to a woman in a professional context.
**Dear Mr/Ms Jones**

In formal emails we always use the surname, so if the person’s name is Mary Franklin, don’t write Dear Ms. Mary or Dear Ms. Mary Franklin, 
**write Dear Ms. Franklin**

Sometimes you don’t know the name of the person you’re writing to because the email address starts with info or office. In this case write:
**Dear Sir/Madam**

Introducing yourself – name, job title and company
**My name is Susan Whitby and I am the Head of Marketing at HMU.**

Friendly opening – this all depends on your relationship with the person. If you know someone a little better, but still have a formal relationship it might be nice to use a phrase like this at the beginning of your mails. 
**I hope everything is going well.**
**I hope you had a nice Christmas.**

Referring to the last contact between you
**It was lovely meeting you at the sales conference last week.**
**It was nice talking to you on the phone earlier.**
**Thank you for your mail last week.**

Reason for writing
**I am writing in connection with the order we placed last week.**
**I am writing with regard to next week's board meeting.**
**I am writing to update you on the progress of the Masterson project.**
**As discussed, I am sending you more detailed information about the upcoming conference.**

Giving information
**I would like to inform you about the results of our customer survey.**

**Attachments – don’t write "I have enclosed" in an email – we only use that for letters 
I have attached a pdf with the most relevant information.**

Making a request
**Could you please let me know if you can attend the event next week?**
**I would appreciate it if you could send me the documents this week.**
**Would it be possible to deliver the goods one week earlier?**

Making arrangements
I was wondering if you would be available for a meeting next week.
Would 10am be a suitable time?
I am afraid I am not available on Wednesday. Would Thursday work?

I would like to confirm our meeting for 3pm on Wednesday the 11th.
