Evening blue light (480nm wavelength) suppresses melatonin production by 58% and delays circadian phase by 90 minutes, per 2023 *Sleep Medicine* research. Retinal ganglion cells containing melanopsin are 100x more sensitive to blue light than other wavelengths, sending disruptive signals to the suprachiasmatic nucleus. A Harvard Chronobiology trial found 2hrs of screen exposure after dusk reduces REM sleep by 31% and increases cortisol awakening response by 27%, impairing metabolic and cognitive recovery.  

**Mitigation Protocol:**  
1. Use blue light filters (apps/glasses blocking <450nm post-6pm)  
2. Replace LED bulbs with warm-white (2200K-2700K) after sunset  
3. 20-20-20 rule: 20-second screen break every 20 minutes  
4. Increase daytime natural light exposure (↑ circadian contrast)  
5. Blackout curtains + sleep mask for melatonin optimization  

*2023 Clinical Insights:*  
- Johns Hopkins: Amber lenses ↓ insomnia severity by 44% in shift workers  
- 17% ↑ melatonin amplitude with 3-day "digital sunset" (UC San Diego Study)  
- Blue light reduction ↑ leptin sensitivity by 23% (obesity prevention)  

*Contraindications:*  
- Seasonal affective disorder: consult before full elimination  
- Night workers requiring alertness: strategic timed exposure  
- Retinal diseases (e.g., macular degeneration): prioritize ophthalmologist guidance
