What exactly do you mean by "exclusive" content?
I'm sorry but I'm not familiar with that term. Maybe you could explain it in other words?

**REACTING NEGATIVELY**

I'm sorry, but that's completely out of the question - it's waste of time!
I'm afraid that makes absolutely no sense to me.
Sorry, but it's just not feasible. It's too expensive. ( not feasible: can't be done/achieved )

**CHALLENGING SUGGESTIONS**

Has it accoured to you that we will probably lose a lot of customers if we go in this direction? ( has it accoured to you: have you thought about )

Negative questions:
Woudn't it be better to try option two first?
Won't that create a lot of uncertainty among our staff?

Auxiliary verbs for emphasis:
