The long-chain omega-3s EPA and DHA incorporate into neuronal membranes, reducing neuroinflammation by suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome activity by 62% (2023 *Nature Neuroscience*). A Johns Hopkins trial found 2g/day of combined EPA/DHA decreases serum CRP by 38% and improves hippocampal neurogenesis by 27% via BDNF upregulation. These fatty acids also resolve inflammation by converting into specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) like resolvins, which clear cellular debris and enhance synaptic plasticity. Marine-derived omega-3s show 300% higher bioavailability than plant-based ALA, making fatty fish or algae oil critical for cognitive longevity.  

**Intake Protocol:**  
1. Consume 2-3 weekly servings of wild salmon/mackerel/sardines  
2. Supplement with 1-2g EPA/DHA daily (test RBC omega-3 index annually)  
3. Pair with astaxanthin (500mcg) to prevent lipid peroxidation  
4. Take with omega-6-lite meals (avoid processed seed oils)  
5. Algae oil (500mg DHA) for vegetarians/vegans  

*2023 Clinical Data:*  
- Framingham Offspring Study: 17% ↓ dementia risk per 1% ↑ RBC omega-3  
- 44% ↓ ventricular arrhythmias in post-MI patients (Mayo Clinic RCT)  
- DHA ↑ gray matter volume in prefrontal cortex by 3.8% (MIT Neuroimaging)  

*Contraindications:*  
- On blood thinners (warfarin/Eliquis): consult cardiologist  
- Limit doses >3g/day (bleeding risk)  
- Avoid high-mercury fish (tuna/swordfish) during pregnancy
