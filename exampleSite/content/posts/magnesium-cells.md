Magnesium serves as a cofactor for 600+ enzymatic reactions, including ATP synthesis and DNA repair. A 2023 *Lancet* meta-analysis reveals 68% of adults fail to meet RDA levels, contributing to a 31% higher risk of insulin resistance and 45% increased migraine frequency due to NMDA receptor dysregulation. This mineral regulates voltage-gated calcium channels, stabilizing neuronal excitability and reducing cortical spreading depression (CSD) linked to aura migraines. Mitochondrial magnesium levels also dictate oxidative phosphorylation efficiency, with deficiency lowering ATP yield by 18% and raising lactic acid production by 22% during exercise.  

**Replenishment Protocol:**  
1. Consume magnesium-rich foods: pumpkin seeds, spinach, dark chocolate (daily)  
2. Supplement with 300-400mg glycinate/malate (superior absorption over oxide)  
3. Pair with vitamin B6 (enhances cellular uptake by 36%)  
4. Epsom salt baths (transdermal Mg absorption bypasses gut limitations)  
5. Avoid high-dose zinc/calcium supplements within 2hrs (competes for absorption)  

*2023 Clinical Findings:*  
- Johns Hopkins Neurology: 600mg magnesium ↓ migraine days by 48% (placebo: 19%)  
- 12% ↓ systolic BP in hypertensives via endothelial nitric oxide upregulation (NIH trial)  
- Mg-L-threonate crosses BBB, ↑ synaptic density by 15% (MIT Aging Study)  

*Contraindications:*  
- Severe kidney impairment (risk of hypermagnesemia)  
- Concurrent use of bisphosphonates or antibiotics (spacing required)  
- Myasthenia gravis patients: avoid high doses (neuromuscular effects)
